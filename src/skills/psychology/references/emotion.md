# Psychology: emotional UX, Peak-End, processing fluency

See `../../../shared/evidence-model.md` and `severity-model.md` for how to report findings from these rules. Read `ethics.md` before treating any mechanism below as a recommendation rather than a description.

| ID | Rule | Evidence | Default severity | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PE01 | Functional, reliable, and usable behavior is the prerequisite for "delight"; decorative delight cannot compensate for broken core tasks. | Strong | Major | NN/g A Theory of User Delight |
| PE02 | Protect high-intensity moments such as payment, destructive actions, errors, first success, and completion because they disproportionately shape remembered experience. | Contextual psychological evidence | Moderate | NN/g The Peak-End Rule; Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber & Redelmeier, "When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End" (1993) |
| PE03 | Give meaningful tasks a clear sense of closure and next-state certainty; celebrate proportionately rather than adding noise after trivial actions. | Contextual | Moderate | NN/g The Peak-End Rule; NN/g Feedback/status guidance |
| PE04 | Do not use the Peak-End rule as permission to neglect the middle of the journey; it describes memory weighting, not a replacement for end-to-end usability. | Ethical/research guardrail | Major | NN/g The Peak-End Rule; Kahneman et al. (1993) |
| PE05 | Use positive reinforcement for genuine accomplishment, not for coerced actions, permission grants, purchases, or consent. | Ethical guardrail | Major | NN/g Deceptive Patterns in UX |
| PE06 | Clear language, familiar patterns, coherent typography, and consistent hierarchy can improve processing fluency and perceived quality; do not mistake perceived ease for measured usability. | Psychological mechanism | Moderate | Reber, Schwarz & Winkielman, "Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure" (2004); NN/g 5 Principles of Visual Design in UX |
| PE07 | Attractive design can increase perceived ease and tolerance for minor issues, so evaluators must observe task performance rather than infer usability from visual polish. | Research guardrail | Moderate | NN/g A Theory of User Delight; Reber, Schwarz & Winkielman (2004) |

## How the psychology skill should apply these

PE01, PE06, and PE07 are a standing caution against this skill's own bias: a polished, fluent-feeling interface can look better than it functions, so always prioritize verified task success over aesthetic impression when the two evidence sources conflict. PE02-PE04 (Peak-End) are useful for diagnosing which moments in a journey deserve the most design attention, but PE04 is a hard guard — never let "the end was good" excuse an unresolved usability problem in the middle of the flow. PE05 is an ethics-adjacent rule: positive reinforcement (celebration, "nice job" copy) applied to something the user was pressured or tricked into doing fails the four-gate test in `ethics.md` and should be flagged, not praised.
