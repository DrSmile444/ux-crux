# ux-crux/accessibility Specification

## Purpose

Defines the accessibility lens covering WCAG conformance and inclusive interaction for mobile UIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Platform-correct target size and contrast checks
The accessibility skill SHALL evaluate touch target size against the platform-specific minimum (iOS 44x44pt, Android 48x48dp, WCAG 2.2 for web/hybrid content) and text contrast against WCAG AA minimums, and SHALL NOT apply a single universal target-size constant across all platforms.

#### Scenario: Reviewing an Android-only screen
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence is explicitly Android
- **THEN** the accessibility skill applies the 48x48dp minimum rather than iOS's 44x44pt figure

### Requirement: Non-visual and non-gesture access
The accessibility skill SHALL check that all essential functionality is available without relying on color alone, without requiring a specific complex gesture that has no accessible alternative, and with correct accessible names, roles, and reading order for assistive technology.

#### Scenario: Drag-only reordering
- **WHEN** a reviewed feature's only way to reorder items is a drag gesture with no alternative
- **THEN** the accessibility skill flags this as a blocker-severity finding

### Requirement: Text-scaling resilience
The accessibility skill SHALL evaluate whether the UI remains usable when text is scaled up (Dynamic Type or scalable Android text units), flagging clipped, overlapping, or off-screen essential content.

#### Scenario: Enlarged text clips a button label
- **WHEN** evidence shows a button label clipping at a larger accessibility text size
- **THEN** the accessibility skill reports this at blocker or major severity depending on whether the action remains reachable

### Requirement: Instructional and action-verb language accessibility
The accessibility skill SHALL flag instructional or help microcopy that describes a control by its visual/spatial position (for example "the button below," "the panel on the right") instead of the order of actions to take, since assistive technology reads content in document order and responsive layouts reposition elements. The accessibility skill SHALL also flag call-to-action or instructional copy that names a specific input hardware action (for example "Click," "Tap," "Press") where a device-agnostic action verb ("Select," "Choose," "View") would serve equally well, since interfaces are operated by mouse, touch, voice, and switch-access devices; this SHALL NOT apply to copy that is deliberately teaching a specific physical gesture (for example "Pinch to zoom").

#### Scenario: Spatial instruction instead of chronological order
- **WHEN** reviewed help text reads "Click the OK button below to continue" or otherwise instructs the user based on an element's on-screen position
- **THEN** the accessibility skill flags the spatial-language dependency and recommends chronological phrasing (for example "Next, select OK to continue")

#### Scenario: Hardware-specific verb on a multi-modal interface
- **WHEN** reviewed CTA copy on a responsive or multi-modal surface reads "Click here to submit" without any hardware-specific gesture being taught
- **THEN** the accessibility skill recommends a device-agnostic verb such as "Select" instead

#### Scenario: Copy intentionally teaches a physical gesture
- **WHEN** reviewed copy explicitly teaches a specific touch gesture the interface requires (for example "Pinch to zoom out")
- **THEN** the accessibility skill does not flag the hardware-specific verb under this requirement

### Requirement: Digital equity and graceful degradation across hardware and connectivity tiers
The accessibility skill SHALL, distinct from its existing WCAG/disability-focused rule set, check a reviewed design's assumptions about hardware capability, network connectivity, and digital literacy against Kranzberg's First Law of Technology ("technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral"). The skill SHALL flag a design that fails, degrades unacceptably, or becomes unusable under low-bandwidth connectivity, on older or budget-tier devices, or without high-speed continuous connectivity, when the product's plausible user base includes users in those conditions. The skill SHALL NOT apply this requirement to a specialized enterprise or professional tool whose evidence establishes that a minimum hardware/connectivity tier is a legitimate, stated requirement.

#### Scenario: App unusable without continuous high-speed connectivity
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows a consumer mobile app that fails or becomes unusable under intermittent or low-bandwidth connectivity, with no offline or degraded-connectivity state, and the product's plausible user base is not restricted to guaranteed high-connectivity environments
- **THEN** the accessibility skill flags the missing graceful-degradation path as a digital-equity finding, distinct from the existing WCAG conformance rules

#### Scenario: Specialized enterprise tool with a stated hardware minimum
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence establishes that the product is a specialized enterprise tool with a documented minimum hardware/network requirement for its verified user base
- **THEN** the accessibility skill does not flag the hardware/connectivity assumption under this requirement
