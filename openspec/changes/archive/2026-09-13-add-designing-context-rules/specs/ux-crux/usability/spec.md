## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Mode changes are visibly signaled
The usability skill SHALL flag a persistent ("sticky") interaction mode — where the same user action produces different results depending on an active mode set earlier — when the current mode is not visibly and continuously indicated to the user. A momentary mode held only while a modifier control is actively pressed (a quasimode) is exempt from this requirement, since its own physical/interactive state is the visibility signal.

#### Scenario: Sticky mode has no persistent visual indicator
- **WHEN** a reviewed tool has a persistent mode switch (for example a "draw" vs. "select" tool mode) that changes what an identical gesture does, with no continuously visible indicator of which mode is currently active
- **THEN** the usability skill flags this as a mode-error risk finding

#### Scenario: Mode is held only while a modifier is pressed
- **WHEN** a reviewed control changes behavior only while the user actively holds a modifier key or button, reverting the instant it is released
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag a missing-mode-indicator finding, since the held state itself signals the mode

#### Scenario: Sticky mode has a persistent, high-contrast indicator
- **WHEN** a reviewed tool's active mode is shown continuously and prominently (for example a highlighted toolbar icon or a persistent mode label) for as long as that mode is active
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag this requirement

### Requirement: Reused icons do not carry conflicting meanings in close proximity
The usability skill SHALL flag the same icon or visual signifier (for example a generic "X") used for two different actions with materially different consequences when both appear close together in the same view, distinct from the control-truthfulness requirement, which addresses a single control's own label/effect mismatch rather than one signifier meaning different things at different nearby locations.

#### Scenario: Identical icon closes one item and declines another nearby
- **WHEN** a reviewed interface uses the same "X" icon in close proximity for both "close this view" and a distinct, higher-consequence action (for example "decline this meeting invitation")
- **THEN** the usability skill flags the icon-reuse ambiguity as a finding

#### Scenario: Nearby controls use distinct icons and labels for distinct actions
- **WHEN** a reviewed interface uses visually distinct icons, colors, or explicit text labels for two different nearby actions with different consequences
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag an icon-reuse-ambiguity finding

### Requirement: Structural scoping stays consistent across devices
The usability skill SHALL flag a case where a containment, scoping, or default-audience rule established in one device's or viewport's interaction context (for example posting from within a specific group's view) does not carry over to another device or viewport of the same product, silently resetting to a broader or different default instead.

#### Scenario: Mobile resets a scoping default that desktop preserves
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows that performing an action from within a specific scoped context (for example posting while viewing one group) automatically applies that scope on desktop, but the same action on the mobile app resets to a broader or unscoped default requiring extra manual steps
- **THEN** the usability skill flags the cross-device scoping inconsistency as a finding

#### Scenario: Scoping behavior matches across devices
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows the same containment or scoping default applied consistently regardless of which device or viewport the action was performed on
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag this requirement

### Requirement: Search and discovery preserve context across a non-linear session
The usability skill SHALL flag a search or discovery flow that clears the user's query terms, filters, or browsing context after each search execution or navigation step, when the underlying task plausibly involves an evolving, non-linear search session (a user refining or pivoting their query as they learn more, rather than a single one-shot lookup).

#### Scenario: Search results page clears the query and strips related context
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows that executing a search clears the entered query terms and removes access to related categories or filters from the results view, forcing the user to restart from a blank search each time they want to pivot
- **THEN** the usability skill flags the missing search-context preservation as a finding

#### Scenario: Search preserves query terms and supports pivoting
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows a search flow that keeps the query visible and editable, and offers related filters or categories the user can pivot into without restarting
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag this requirement

#### Scenario: Task is a single, direct transactional lookup
- **WHEN** the reviewed evidence shows a strict transactional lookup (for example tracking a package by its ID) rather than an evolving exploratory search
- **THEN** the usability skill does not flag this requirement solely because query terms are not preserved
